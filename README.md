# [ts-scaffold-f-api](https://github.com/asleepysamurai/ts-scaffold-f-api)

This is a scaffold app for a Typescript + Node + Postgres API server. I fork this app and use it as the base whenever I want to create a new API server.

Frequently updated to incorporate changes from the forks.

## Todo: Cleanup committed secrets

Ideally secrets should not be committed to git, but since the secrets committed here are only ever used locally in my dev environment, I'm going to be lazy about it for now.

## Forked for WunderMobility Take Home Coding Challenge

Gutted all of the db, server, and API related code, since this challenge just requires a couple of scripts.

## Running instructions

    yarn install
    yarn start
